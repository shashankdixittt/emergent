The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Personal Development Dashboard iteratively, starting from a basic habit tracker. The initial request was for a 30-day, 5-habit tracker with focused hours, storing data in local storage. Key developments included extending the challenge to 100 days, increasing habits from 5 to 10, adding a Toggl-like Time Tracker, and implementing a robust  for local storage persistence. A significant portion of the trajectory involved debugging display issues, incorrect calculations (e.g., Day 100 of 100 on first use), and refining UI elements. The AI demonstrated adaptability in modifying existing components and creating new ones based on user feedback, ultimately delivering a feature-rich, frontend-only application with persistent local storage.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a web page functioning as a personal tracker, storing data in local storage. This page should contain:
1.  **Protocol Tracker**: A tabular form for tracking 5 daily habits over 30 days, with habits named habit 1 to habit 5. Checkboxes should be functional.
2.  **Focused Hours Tracker**: A section below the protocol tracker to track focused hours per day. This should be a tabular form with hours (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) on the left column and days (Day 1-30) on the top row. Entries should be color-coded dots, forming a line graph connecting daily values.

**Subsequent enhancements and fixes:**
*   **Habit Renaming**: Rename habits to: No Social Media, No Songs, No Maggie/Chai/Coffee, 1min Self Video Recording, 45min Book Reading, Meditation.
*   **Extend Challenge Duration**: Increase the tracking period from 30 days to 100 days for both habit and focus hours tracking.
*   **Add More Protocols**: Increase the number of protocols from 6 to 10 with new names: No Insta/FB, No Songs, No Maggie, Mindful Eating, No PMO, WakeUp @8pm, 45min Book Reading, Meditation, Revise Notes, 3hrs of Tech.
*   **Time Tracking Feature**: Implement a live time tracker similar to Toggl, allowing users to start, pause, stop timing for activities, and view entries in a calendar format.
*   **Dashboard Refinements**:
    *   Remove This Weeks Performance" and "Top Performing Habit" sections.
    *   Remove "100-Day Challenge Insights" section.
    *   Add a personalized greeting for "Shashank".
    *   Remove "Reset to Day 1" button.
    *   Ensure milestones are not pre-achieved.
    *   Ensure Focus Hours starts with 0 data.
*   **UI/UX Improvements**: Fix layout of protocol cards to a single horizontal line with equal alignment. Fix protocol names in the table header to be single-line.
*   **Data Persistence**: Ensure all data (habits, focus hours, time logs) persists across browser refreshes using local storage.
*   **Focus Hours Challenges**: Update challenges from 500h/750h/1000h to 100hrs/250hrs/500hrs.
*   **Fix Focus Hours Graph Design**: Improve the design of the 100-day progress trend graph on the focus hours page.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main application entry point. Handles routing using `react-router-dom`. Initially contained a "Hello World" API call to backend, but now primarily renders the `Navigation` component.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated `Navigation` component for overall app structure, removed initial API call.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/HabitTracker.jsx**: Implements the core 100-day, 10-protocol tracking grid. Displays checkboxes, calculates daily progress, and interacts with local storage.
    -   **Changes**: Extended from 30 days/5 habits to 100 days/10 habits. Implemented specific habit names. Updated styling for a single-line horizontal display of protocol names. Integrated `DataManager` for persistence.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FocusHoursTracker.jsx**: Manages the tracking and visualization of focused hours. Displays a grid of color-coded dots for daily hour selection and a trend line graph.
    -   **Changes**: Extended from 30 days to 100 days. Reworked UI from complex CSS grid to proper HTML table structure. Added `DataManager` for persistence. Initialized with empty data to prevent old data display.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx**: Provides the tabbed navigation structure (Dashboard, Protocols, Focus Hours, Time Tracker, Goals, Analytics).
    -   **Changes**: Added new tabs for `Dashboard`, `TimeTracker`, `GoalSetting`, `Analytics`. Fixed typo.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx**: The central overview page, displaying challenge progress, statistics, and achievements.
    -   **Changes**: Extended for 100-day challenge and 10 habits. Removed "This Weeks Performance, Top Performing Habit, and 100-Day Challenge Insights sections. Added Hi Shashank! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome... greeting. Refined calculation logic for current day and progress to accurately reflect fresh starts and actual completion (many bug fixes around Day 0/100 calculation). Achievements logic updated to reflect actual progress.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TimeTracker.jsx**: Implements a live timer with project categories and a calendar view, inspired by Toggl.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation. Implemented timer logic, project management, calendar display. Integrated  for persistence. Fixed initial state to start fresh.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/GoalSetting.jsx**: Manages personal goals and milestones, including those related to habits and focus hours.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated for 100-day challenge. Updated focus hour targets to 100hrs, 250hrs, 500hrs. Logic for milestone achievement. Integrated  for persistence.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Analytics.jsx**: Intended for displaying analytical insights, though its content wasn't explicitly detailed in the trajectory.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/utils/dataManager.js**: A new utility class responsible for abstracting  interactions, ensuring robust data persistence and retrieval across all components. It handles multiple data keys and provides methods for saving, loading, and clearing data.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation and integration across all data-dependent components.
-   **/app/frontend/src/mock.js**: Stores mock data used during frontend-only development before backend integration.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to support 6 habits, then 10 habits, reflecting the evolving habit structure.
-   **/app/contracts.md**: Document outlining API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation plan, and frontend-backend integration strategy.
    -   **Changes**: Created to capture initial backend plan, updated to reflect 6 habits. (No further updates seen in trajectory).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the Focus Hours challenges. The user requested to change the focus hours goals from 500h/750h/1000h to 100hrs/250hrs/500hrs.

The AI engineer successfully implemented these changes:
-   **FocusHoursTracker.jsx**: The display on the Focus Hours page now shows 100hrs Challenge - 0% Complete, 250hrs Challenge - 0% Complete, and 500hrs Challenge - 0% Complete with visual progress bars.
-   **GoalSetting.jsx**: The Goals section has been updated with these new progressive milestones for focus hours:
    -   100 hours (30-day milestone)
    -   250 hours (60-day milestone)
    -   500 hours (100-day milestone)
    -   The corresponding progress calculation logic in  was also updated to reflect these new targets.

All these changes have been made and verified through a screenshot (), which shows the updated challenges and their initial 0% completion. Data persistence for these goals is also in place.

The user's very next request, which is currently pending, is to fix the design of the 100-day progress trend graph on the Focus Hours page.
